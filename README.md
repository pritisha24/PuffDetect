Smoker or Non-Smoker Identification Using Machine Learning
-----------------------------------------------------------

A predictive model that identifies smoking patterns through health parameters.

 Overview
-------------

PuffDetect uses machine learning to determine whether an individual is a smoker or non-smoker based on health-related data inputs.
It’s built to support early risk detection and preventive health initiatives.

🩺 Features
-------------

🧠 Predicts if a person is a Smoker or Non-Smoker using trained ML model

⚙️ Built with Gradient Boosting Classifier for high performance

📊 Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

🧾 Accuracy achieved: 83%

⚙️ Tech Stack
---------------

  Languages: Python

  Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

 Model Used: Gradient Boosting Classifier

  Interface: Simple CLI / GUI via Tkinter

🧩 Workflow
------------

  User enters medical data (e.g., CO level, heart rate, lung capacity).

  Data is passed to the trained Gradient Boosting model.

  The model outputs “Smoker” or “Non-Smoker” instantly.
